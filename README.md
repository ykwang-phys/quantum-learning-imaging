# Code Repository for *Advancing Quantum Imaging through Learning Theory*

This repository contains the source code used to generate all results presented in the paper *Advancing Quantum Imaging through Learning Theory*. The scripts reproduce every figure in both the main text and the Supplemental Material.

The scripts are organized to reproduce every figure in both the main text and the Supplemental Material:

- **Main Text Figures**: `main_fig*.py`  
- **Supplemental Material Figures**: `SM_fig*.py`  

Each script is self-contained and can be executed directly to reproduce the corresponding figure.

## System requirements
- Programming language: Python 3.12  
- Dependencies: NumPy (v1.26.4), SciPy (v1.13.1), Matplotlib (v3.9.2)  
- Non-standard hardware: None (runs on a normal desktop/laptop computer)  

## Installation guide
Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ykwang-phys/quantum-learning-imaging
cd quantum-learning-imaging
