# Code Repository for *Advancing Quantum Imaging through Learning Theory*

This repository contains the code used to generate all results presented in the paper *Advancing Quantum Imaging through Learning Theory*.

The scripts are organized to reproduce every figure in both the main text and the Supplemental Material:

- **Main Text Figures**: `main_fig*.py`  
- **Supplemental Material Figures**: `SM_fig*.py`  

Each script is self-contained and can be executed directly to reproduce the corresponding figure.
